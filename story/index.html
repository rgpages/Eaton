	<p>The 24-year-old Oregon Track Club Elite athlete came into the U.S. Olympic Track &amp; Field Trials as America's next great hope in the decathlon.</p>
	<p>On Saturday, before an adoring crowd of 21,795 at Hayward Field - who wildly cheered his every move over two days of grueling competition staged in horrible weather conditions - he left as the world record-holder with a stunning 9,039 points.</p>
	<p>Eaton, the former prep star at Mountain View High School in Bend, and five-time NCAA champion at Oregon, is the second decathlete in history to score more than 9,000 points. He broke the previous mark of 9,026 set by Roman Sebrle of the Czech Republic in 2001.</p>
	<p>And with that score, not only is Eaton branded as the "World's Greatest Athlete," but he will head to London as the gold-medal favorite in the decathlon at the Summer Olympics in August.</p>
	<p>For Eaton, the best part of the entire day came during a brief exchange with his coach, Harry Marra, right after he set a lifetime best of 17 feet, 4 1/2 inches in the pole vault.</p>
	<p>He still had two events left - the javelin and 1,500.</p>
	<p>"I looked at him, and I was like, 'All right, what do I have to throw and what do I have to run to get the American record,'" Eaton said. "He stopped me and looked at me, and said, 'Ashton, the world record.' At that moment, I saw his belief in me, and I said, 'Let's go do it.' "</p>
	<p>It was a moment that will never be forgotten by those in attendance.</p>
	<p>The crowd was buzzing in anticipation after Eaton set a decathlon PR of 193-1 in the javelin to give him a legitimate shot at the world record. That intensity was raised a notch when longtime multi-event announcer Frank Zarnowski informed the spectators that their favorite son would need to run 4 minutes, 16.37 seconds in the 10th and final event to complete the task.</p>
	<p>"As soon as Zeke said Ashton was going to try to do this for Eugene, Hayward Field, and the University of Oregon, I knew right then, he's getting this," said Marra, who has coached both Eaton and his fiancee, Brianne Theisen, since the fall of 2009.</p>
	<p>"That's the kind of person Ashton Eaton is. He loves this place."</p>
	<p>The atmosphere was electric when the gun went off, with Curtis Beach moving to the front, followed by Joe Detmer, and Eaton settling into third. They came through the 400 in 67 seconds, hit the 800-meter mark at 2:18, and then slowed a bit on the third lap.</p>
	<p>Eaton was two seconds off world-record pace when he hit the bell lap.</p>
	<p>But he never lost faith.</p>
	<p>"With 600 meters to go, I became a firm believer that the Hayward magic does exist," Eaton said. "Especially with 400 to go. I knew I was two seconds off, but I knew there was no way that I was not going to get the world record, in large part because of the atmosphere around the stadium ...</p>
	<p>"It's a feeling you get even if you're tired, or you think your hamstring might be cramping up, that as soon as the gun is fired, it all goes away. It lets you do what you were made to do, and there are no limitations put in front of you."</p>
	<p>With the crowd on its feet, screaming in unison, Eaton dug deep and ran the final 400 in 62 flat. Over the last 10 meters, both Beach and Detmer stepped aside, cheering Eaton on, allowing him to finish first with a lifetime best of 4:14.48.</p>
	<p>The world record was his, and he turned in disbelief, blowing kisses to the fans, and then making the "O" with his hands.</p>
	<p>Within seconds, he was swallowed up by both Theisen and his mom, Roslyn, with hugs as the cheers continued to cascade down from the stands.</p>
	<p>"That was the coolest moment of my entire life, by far," said Theisen, who will make her own Olympic bid in the heptathlon at the Canadian Olympic Trials next week.</p>
	<p>"I just cried, and he was pretty choked up and trying to catch his breath. I didn't know how much he had left in the tank, but I knew he was going to give it his all."</p>
	<p>For the record, Eaton won seven of the 10 events in the decathlon as he crushed Dan O'Brien's U.S. record of 8,891 and his previous best of 8,729. </p>
	<p>On Friday in a steady rainfall, he set decathlon world records in the 100 and long jump. He continued his torrid pace on Saturday with a 13.70 in the 110 hurdles and 140-5 in the discus.</p>
	<p>Trey Hardee, the two-time reigning world champion, placed second with 8,383 points to secure his second Olympic berth.</p>
	<p>Florida's Gray Horn was third at 7,954, but he won't make the trip to London because he doesn't have the Olympic "A" standard of 8,200.</p>
	<p>Hardee, who is coming back from elbow surgery just nine months ago, paid homage to Eaton's effort, joking that he can tell his kids it "took a world record to beat me."</p>
	<p>"That was the wettest decathlon I've ever done in my life," he said. "I just hope that when Ashton's record is put in the books and written about, that there are all kinds of asterisks to say how crummy the conditions were and just how impressive that mark really was."</p>
	<p>For Eaton, it's more akin to a love affair.</p>
	<p>"I truly love this event," he said. "It's like living an entire lifetime in two days, with ups and downs, good and bad, comebacks. It all happens in two days. Everybody loves life, and I think that's why we all love the decathlon."</p>
